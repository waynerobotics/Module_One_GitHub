# Module One: GitHub (Basics)
The purpose of these training modules is to help you get familiar and comfortable using the tools that we use in the lab. Each module will provide you with a series of tasks to complete. When you complete the task, a team lead will review it and give you authorization to access the next module.

Each module will introduce a new concept for you to build upon, and in the end you will be given a small project using everything you've learned from your training.

## Introduction

GitHub is the version control tool that we use in the lab, and it is very important that you get a good grasp of it before we move on to the other modules. It may seem a bit intimidating for new users, but it will become **much** easier as we continue to use it!

In this module you will be asked to watch the training video by clicking on the image below. It will introduce the GitHub fundamentals and everything you need to get started. You may follow along using your own device, or you may use one of the available PC's in the lab. 

*Please note that you will eventually need your own device to complete tasks in the future.*
